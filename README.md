# SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
- Unilever's canteen is overcrowded, leading to employee dissatisfaction and time management issues. To address this, a meal ordering and reservation system can be implemented, allowing employees to pre-order meals and reducing their time spent in the canteen. Additional strategies include setting up takeaway stations, using a display system for seating availability, and redesigning the space for more seating. These changes aim to reduce congestion, improve the dining experience, and maximize canteen capacity.
